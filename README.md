*theBookRepository* is a bibliography app created under the direction of [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) in his *Modern JavaScript from the Beginning* course. The app uses the following technologies:

  * JavaScript ES5
  * JavaScript ES6
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Skeleton

It is first written in ES5, and then rewritten in ES6 as an OOP exercise in refactoring constructor functions to classes.
